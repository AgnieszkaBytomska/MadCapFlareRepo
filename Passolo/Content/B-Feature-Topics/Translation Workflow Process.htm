        <p>After the source strings are completed by software developers ,project ( .lpu file) is sent by Technical Documentation Specialist via e-mail to translators.  All  untranslated strings (marked red)  should be translated from the source language to the target language by MT highly-qualified, native-speaking linguists.</p>
        <p>Once the content has been updated, linguists and industry experts could also edit the already translated strings (status for review; blue)  for contextual accuracy. to assure all spelling, grammar and cultural perspective are correct and that the translations read fluently. Status will change as pre-translated- approved and verified.</p>
        <p>Translators will have direct access to SDL Passolo software and directly apply the corrections in their translation editor.</p>
        <p>The following steps should be considered into planning workflow process:</p>
        <p>Phase 1: Before Content Goes to Translation – Translation Developers English into source English</p>
        <p>Phase 2: Sending Content to Translation - Extracting LPU File for Translation from SDL Team Edition</p>
        <p>Phase 3: Translation</p>
        <p>Phase 4: Content Returns from Translation - Implementation of  target files to  SDL Team Edition</p>
        <p>Phase 5: After Translation – Implementation files on application/ Testing</p>
        <p>Phase 6: Publishing</p>
